Hi! I'm an undergraduate student majoring in EECS and BMSE at [Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST)](https://www.gist.ac.kr/en/main.html).

My interest lies in understanding **how neuronal signals can be interpreted in relation to cognitive functions**. Through years of research experience in various labs, I've worked with cognitive tasks as well as neural data across multiple scales -- from multielectrode arrays to EEG and fMRI. My goal is to develop computational or theoretical systems that can explain general cognitive phenomena based on neuronal signals.
